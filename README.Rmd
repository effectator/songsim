This package holds a single function to calculate and visualize a "songsim" similarity matrix where cell (i, j) is filled if word i in a song's lyrics is the same as word j. This method was first suggested by [Colin Morris](https://colinmorris.github.io/) (see links below).

Install:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("gsimchoni/songsim")
```

Load:
```{r}
library(songsim)
```

Visualize Beyonce's Formation:
```{r}
path <- system.file("extdata", "formation.txt", package = "songsim")
songsim(path)
```

Use `colorfulMode`:
```{r}
songsim(path, colorfulMode = TRUE)
```

Use `interactiveMode` if you have the `heatmaply` package installed:
```{r}
songsim(path, interactiveMode = TRUE, singleColor = "blue")
```
