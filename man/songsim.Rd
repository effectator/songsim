\title{Calculating and Visualizing a "Song Similarity" matrix}
\usage{
songsim(path = NULL, colorfulMode = FALSE, singleColor = "black",
  interactiveMode = FALSE, mainTitle = "", plotOptions = NULL,
  heatmaplyOptions = NULL, plotMatrix = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to a txt file holding the song's lyrics}

\item{colorfulMode}{A boolean indicating whether to plot the matrix in color
(see @details), defaults to FALSE}

\item{singleColor}{What is the color to use for a full matrix cell (see @details)}

\item{interactiveMode}{A boolean indicating whether to plot the matrix in
interactive mode using the `heatmaply` package (see @details), defaults to FALSE}

\item{mainTitle}{plot's main title, defaults to an empty string}

\item{plotOptions}{Additional parameters for the base `plot` function
(non-interactive mode)}

\item{heatmaplyOptions}{Additional parameters for the `heatmaply` function
(non-interactive mode)}

\item{plotMatrix}{A boolean indicating whether to plot the matrix, defaults to TRUE}
}
\value{
a list containing:
\item{songMat}{a song similarity square matrix of dimensions no. of words x
no. of words, containing all 0 and 1}
\item{repetitiveness}{an experimental measure of repetitiveness which is the
mean of the upper triangular part of song matrix}
}
\description{
This function will calculate the "song similarity" of a given song's lyrics
stored in a text file. A cell (i, j) is filled if word i in a song's lyrics
is the same as word j. This method was first suggested by Colin Morris
(see URLs)
}
\details{
A cell (i, j) in a songsim square matrix is filled if word i in a song's lyrics
is the same as word j. This simple rule would create fascintaing visualizations
of songs lyrics as shown in the links below.

If colorfulMode is set to TRUE, each word which appears more than once will be
colored with its own color (only available with interactiveMode set to FALSE).

If interactiveMode is set to TRUE and the user has the \code{heatmaply} package
installed - the songsim matrix will be plotted using an interactive heatmap.

The \code{singleColor} corresponds to the color a full cell is colored with.
If in \code{colorfulMode} it would be the color of words which appear only once.
}
\note{
This function was only tested on typical pop songs or poems, it was not tested
on large pieces of texts
